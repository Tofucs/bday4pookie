# Birthday card for my pooks

Custom birthday card with dialouge, made using react + vite in WSL.
To edit in WSL, install npm, node.js, and vite through: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/react-on-wsl and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-wsl









### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
